# Stupid discord stuff

A simple cli tool with json config which lets you update the image in your
custom activity every time you or someone else sends a message in the channels
you subscribed to in the config.

Simply copy the `config.example.json` file to `config.json` and fill
with the config data you want.

Will create an `auth.json` file with refresh token in this root folder.
